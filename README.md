Anakin Skywalker : Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire!

Obi-Wan Kenobi : Your new Empire?

Anakin Skywalker : Don't make me kill you.

Obi-Wan Kenobi : Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!

Anakin Skywalker : If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.

Obi-Wan Kenobi : Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
